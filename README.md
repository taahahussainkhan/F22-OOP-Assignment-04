/*										Assignment 4

Write a simple function template for predicate function isEqualTo that compares its two arguments of the same type with the equality operator (==) and returns true if they are equal and false otherwise. Use this function template in a program that calls isEqualTo only with a variety of fundamental types. Now write a separate version of the program that calls isEqualTo with a user-defined class type, but does not overload the equality operator. What happens when you attempt to run this program? Now overload the equality operator (with the operator function) operator==.Now what happens when you attempt to run this program?

For user-defined type, you can use this class given below:
Class student
{
	int age;
	double weight;
};

Make its constructor as needed and work on the functionality explained in the task given in original statement.
